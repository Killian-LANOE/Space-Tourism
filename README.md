# Doing the challenge of space-tourism from : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3 .

I'm doing this challenge on my free time, i will use React & Sass to improve myself.
I try to learn more about dev especially Frontend, as i started a year ago i will probably make misstakes or unnecessary long code / repetitions. I will try to fixe it along the way as i see them & later once i've finished the challenge.


## Update after finishing project

This project doesn't suit me i will redo it later in this year with the good semantic as such i'm leaving it here for now as it's working but will be updated at a later date
